# go-tour
Tutorial presentation to introduce the Go programming language.

This is a work in progress.

Eventually I intend to write a set of lessons to teach Go programming.
For now, there is a “whirlwind tour” presentation intended to be given in 30-ish minutes
to provide a basic understanding of what Go is and why it would be worthwhile to continue
studying it.

## Important Note on Content
These materials are *not* designed to be stand-alone training materials.
They are intended to be presented by a knowledgable instructor. As such, there is a lot that
the teacher should be expanding on in addition to what is written on the slides themselves.
Just reading the slides alone only conveys a fraction of the lesson.
